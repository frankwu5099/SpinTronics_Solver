# Solver for spin accumulation and spin current by tensorflow

This program solves spin accumulation and spin current for heavy metal(N) and ferromagnetic insulator(FI) bilayered system,
which is the general case of the system in ***Chen(2016)***. By using ***tensorflow*** to solve differential equation, it can solve 
the system with various spin configuration in the FI.
